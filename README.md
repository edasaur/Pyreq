Pyreq
=====

This is a small lightweight tool that will allow users to import all python modules that they need, in order to run third-party source code. 

Some of the functionality should include:

1. Being able to temporarily add packages that are required by the source code.
2. Being able to remove select packages that you have temporarily installed.
