tmpvirtualenv
=====

tmpvirtualenv is a small and easy-to-use lightweight tool that allows users to create a virtual environment to install all dependencies they need in order to run third-party source code, even without the presence of a requirements file. 


Pyreq also allows users to keep select dependencies that they wish to keep in their actual environment. This is done by the '-p' flag.
