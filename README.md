Pyreq
=====

This is a small lightweight tool that will allow users to import all python modules that they need, in order to run third-party source code. 

Some of the functionality should include:

1. Being able to temporarily add packages that are required by the source code. [x]
2. Being able to remove select packages that you have temporarily installed.


Recently had the realization that people might not want to have an extra bash tool due to possible environment conflicts or lack of shell. Next steps are to create a python script to do all of this (afterall, who wouldn't have python installed if they were using this tool?)


More details to follow
